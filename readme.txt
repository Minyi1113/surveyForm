1. Show a new following required question, asking the name(s) of the received vaccine(s), only if the user answered “Yes” to the question “Have you ever received a vaccine?”.
If the user changed the answer later by selecting “No” to the question “Have you ever received a vaccine?”, the showed new following question should be hidden, and consequently, it won’t be a required question.

2. Change the color of “required Indicator” to red, for All required fields at the same time, if they are still missing.

3. Show warning messages inside the webpage (instead of a pop-up alert), to remind the names of the required fields, if they are still missing.
